# Connect4Ruby
This is my first project in Ruby! I didnt know what to do so I just made a Connect 4
Actually, apart from code golfing, I don't think that I'm going to use it a lot.
It's funny to learn, and to code in Ruby, but whitout Rails, there is no things that you can do with Ruby and you can't do in other languages
